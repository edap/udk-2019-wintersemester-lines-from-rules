# Lines from rules

How little is needed to create a visual composition? this course focuses on how to obtain generative forms with the smallest amount of code possible.
The students will code a set of rules and instructions to draw lines, squares, points and circles on the computer's screen.

## First week assignement

Create a sketch using your favourite creative coding framework (Processing, openFrameworks, three.js, paper.js, p5.js, nannou, you name it), using only 5 lines of code.

- Read the wikipedia article on [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).
- Write down on a piece of paper what each line is doing, as you were explain your code to a rubber duck.
- Propose 3 variations of your sketch. For each variation write down what did you change and how it affects the visual output.

P.S.
- The 5 lines of code have to be in the `draw` method. Any code related to resources inizialization, like the code that in an openFrameworks application goes into the `ofApp.h` file, or that one that in Processing goes into the `setup` method, does not count.
- Each line can not be longer than 80 chars, space included.
